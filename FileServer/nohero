Don’t you shut your eyes
And hide your heart behind a shadow
Cause you can count on me
As long as I can breathe
You should know
I’ll carry out through the night
Through the storm
Give you love only love in return
I can’t jump over buildings i’m no hero
But love can do miracles
I cannot run a bullet
I’m no hero
But i’d take one for you
